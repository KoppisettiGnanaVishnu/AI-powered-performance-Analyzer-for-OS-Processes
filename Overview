The OS Performance Monitor is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to track, analyze, and predict system performance metrics 
such as CPU and memory usage. This tool provides real-time insights into the system's performance and identifies patterns using 
historical data analysis. By visualizing trends, users can predict potential performance issues and take preventive measures. The
application is built using Python's Flask framework to manage backend processes and ensure smooth data handling. On the frontend, 
Bootstrap is integrated to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. The tool features an intuitive dashboard that 
presents performance data in an organized manner, enabling users to monitor and understand resource utilization efficiently. 
In addition to visualization, the system identifies performance bottlenecks and provides optimization suggestions for improving overall 
efficiency. By combining data analysis, prediction capabilities, and user- centric design, this application is ideal for system 
administrators and developers seeking proactive monitoring solutions.
