1.Define Scope & Requirements
Target System: Are you analyzing cloud servers, edge devices, or on-premise machines?

Metrics to Monitor: CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, network traffic, etc.

Performance Goals: Do you need high-frequency monitoring (real-time) or batch processing?

AI Objectives: Identify bottlenecks, suggest optimizations, predict resource needs.

2. Data Collection & Processing
A. System Monitoring
You'll need to gather real-time performance metrics. Consider using:

Linux: top, htop, iostat, vmstat, sar, psutil (Python).

Windows: Performance Counters, wmic, PowerShell, psutil.

Cloud Systems: AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Operations Suite.

B. Real-time Data Streaming
For real-time analysis, you need a data pipeline:

Kafka / RabbitMQ: Message queuing for large-scale systems.

Flask/FastAPI Web APIs: If data is fetched via API.

Prometheus + Grafana: Metrics collection and visualization.

3. AI/ML Model Selection
To analyze and forecast performance, you need different AI techniques:

A. Bottleneck Detection
Anomaly Detection (Detect system slowdowns)

Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, One-Class SVM

Statistical Methods (Baseline comparison)

Z-score, Moving Averages

B. Optimization Suggestion
Reinforcement Learning (RL):

Train an RL agent to suggest optimizations (e.g., Redis caching, scaling rules).

Rule-Based Systems:

Define static thresholds for CPU/memory and suggest fixes
